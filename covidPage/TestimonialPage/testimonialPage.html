            <img class="testimony-image" src="https://webcentral.uc.edu/eprof/media/repository/0178KamathSuresh0192.jpg" alt="Suresh kamath">
            <p>Suresh Kamath, the managing director of Chennai based Laser Soft Infosystems Ltd is an unusual man. Unlike most other entrepreneurs, he does not aspire to create a business empire; his sole ambition is to provide employment to 10,000 people. He also plans to reserve 40 per cent of the jobs for the disabled.
                Suresh started Laser Soft in 1986 with just Rs 200 and five people. Today, the company is a force to reckon with in the banking software arena.

            <p>Kalyan Varma, wildlife photography was the realisation of a childhood dream. He would spend hours glued to the television, watching programmes on National Geographic and BBC, equally entranced by the captivating visuals and the mellifluous voice of David Attenborough. But, soon he realised that “it had become a medium for me to explore and showcase our wonderful wildlife and more importantly how badly we are screwing it up”.</p>
